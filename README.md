# terraform-aws-webapp
This is a simple web application using Python Flask, Docker, Terraform and AWS.

# Architecture
This network architecture has three subnet tiers split across three availability zones. The subnets will also have a VPC routing table that will provide it access to the internet. The Security Group will allow port 22 access to those that have the relevant .pem file, this will allow the EC2 host to be configured upon start-up using the commands located in prod>modules>EC2>main.tf

# Prerequisites
* An AWS Account with an IAM user capable of creating resources – `AdminstratorAccess`
* A locally configured AWS profile for the above IAM user
* Terraform installation - [steps](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
* AWS EC2 key pair - [steps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html)
* Environment Variables for AWS CLI - [steps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)

# How to Apply/Destroy
This section details the deployment and teardown of the three-tier-architecture. **Warning: this will create AWS resources that costs money**

**Deployment steps**

1.	Clone the repo
`git clone`

2.	Access the prod environment
`cd prod`

3.	Initialise the working directory, which contains the tf configuration 
`terraform init`

4.	 Ensure the terraform code is formatted and validated 
`terraform fmt` and `terraform validate`

5.	Create an execution plan
`terraform plan`

6.	Execute terraform configuration 
`terraform apply --auto-approve`

**Docker/Webapp Flask Deployment Steps**

7.  Change directory to 'files'
`cd files`

8.  Start the Container using Docker-Compose
`docker-compose up -d`

9.  Test connectivity to the Python Flask Webapp
`curl http://localhost:8080`
      `Hello World!`

    OR

    Access a browser and enter -
    `http://<IP>:8080`

**Teardown steps**

1.	Destroy the deployed AWS Infrastructure 
`terraform destroy --auto-approve`
